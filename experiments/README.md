## Experiments with cxsom

Here are gathered several experiments. They aim to be used as a tutorial. Each directory contains a specific experiment. For each experiment, you will be given a README.md file, where you can copy-paste commands to run the experiment. You will be also provided with a makefile, that is also a tutorial, and some python and c++ code.. which are tutorials as well.

Here is a suggestion of the order in which you can try experiments, but every experiment can be tried independently from the others.

- [basic-som](basic-som)
- [basic-recsom](basic-recsom)
- [basic-xsom](basic-xsom)
- [basic-sked](basic-xsom)
- [completion-xsom](completion-xsom)
